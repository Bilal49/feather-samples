This sample demonstrates how to create a simple MVC Books widget with Feather. You leverage the attribute routing of MVC 5 and the Feather UI framework in the context of a Sitefinity widget. The Books widget displays a list of books on the frontend and tracks on the client the points retrieved for each book.

The code sample is described in details in our Sitefinity documentation [Feather: Create a Book widget](http://docs.sitefinity.com/feather-create-a-book-widget).
