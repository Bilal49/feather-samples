*Customize the Content block toolbar*
=====================================

The content block widget in Feather uses the Kendo editor
([link](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/editor/index)). It enables you
to specify which tools are available in the editor toolbar. The
Feather’s Content block leverages this and sets a predefined list of
tools. You are able to alter this list of tools in several ways,
depending on the scope of the changes you wish to achieve.

You can change the Content Block toolbar globally (for the default
Feather Content Block widget) as described [here](../BoldlessContentBlock) and [here](../CustomStylesContentBlock).

You can also decide that you don’t want to alter the default Feather
Content Block widget designer but create your own with different set of
tools in the toolbar. You can achieve that by creating your custom
widget (explained
[here](http://docs.sitefinity.com/feather-create-widgets)) or use our
github sample
([here](https://github.com/Sitefinity/feather-samples/tree/master/SimpleContentBlock))
as a start.

To run this sample:

1. Clone the [feather-samples](https://github.com/Sitefinity/feather-samples) repository.
4. Build the **SimpleContentBlock** project. 
5. Reference the **SimpleContentBlock.dll** from your Sitefinity’s web application.
